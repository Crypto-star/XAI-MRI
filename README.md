ðŸ§  XAI-MRI: Explainable AI for Brain Tumor Detection
XAI-MRI is a deep learning-powered diagnostic tool designed for explainable brain tumor detection using MRI images. The system combines state-of-the-art EfficientNetB4 for high-accuracy classification, Grad-CAM for visual model interpretability, and GPT-based language models to generate clinical-style natural language explanations. Built with a scalable Next.js front end and Python backend, XAI-MRI bridges the gap between AI predictions and clinical usability.

### üß† MRI Report

1. **Findings**  
- **Anomalies:** There is a visible mass located in the anterior cranial fossa.  
- **Size and Shape:** The lesion is approximately 3 cm in diameter, with a lobulated appearance.  
- **Edema and Mass Effect:** Surrounding edema is noted, with slight displacement of adjacent brain structures.

2. **Structural Observations**  
- **Ventricular Size and Symmetry:** The ventricles appear moderately enlarged but symmetrical.  
- **Midline Shift:** No significant midline shift observed.  
- **Integrity of Surrounding Tissues:** The integrity of the surrounding brain structures is compromised due to the mass effect.

3. **Contrast/Signal Characteristics**  
- **T1/T2 Signal Intensity:** The mass exhibits hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images.  
- **Necrosis or Hemorrhage:** No significant necrosis or hemorrhage observed within the lesion.  
- **Enhancement Patterns:** Marked contrast enhancement noted post-contrast administration.

### üìù Summary:  
A lobulated mass in the anterior cranial fossa, approximately 3 cm in diameter, shows significant edema and marked enhancement on contrast imaging, suggesting a potential meningioma.

üîç **Possible Diagnosis**  

- **AI Model Prediction:**  
- **Predicted Tumor Type:** Meningioma  
- **Confidence Level:** 98.9%

- **Other Possible Diagnoses:**  
  - Schwannoma  
  - Glioma  
  - Pituitary adenoma  
  - Dural metastasis  
  - Agree with AI model‚Äôs prediction due to the typical location, enhancement characteristics, and overall imaging findings consistent with meningiomas.

üß™ **Recommended Next Steps**  

- **Additional Imaging:** Obtain a contrast-enhanced MRI for further evaluation and possibly MR spectroscopy.  
- **Biopsy:** Consider biopsy for histopathological confirmation.  
- **Consultation:** Refer to a neuro-oncology specialist for further management.  
- **Treatment Considerations:** Discuss surgical intervention and possible radiation therapy.

‚úÖ **Conclusion**  
The MRI findings indicate a likely meningioma with surrounding edema, warranting further imaging and clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate management strategies.

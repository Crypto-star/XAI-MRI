MRI Report:
**MRI Report:**

1. **Findings:**
   1. **Lesion Characteristics:**
      - A well-defined hyperintense mass is observed in the right frontal region.
      - The lesion displays a homogeneous enhancement post-contrast administration.
   2. **Location:**
      - The mass is located adjacent to the dura mater, suggestive of extra-axial location.
   3. **Effects on Surrounding Structures:**
      - There is minimal midline shift of the brain.
      - No significant edema surrounding the lesion.
   4. **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Spaces:**
      - Normal appearance of the ventricles and CSF spaces.

2. **Summary:**
   - The MRI findings are consistent with an extra-axial mass which is highly suggestive of a meningioma, given its characteristics and location.

Possible Diagnosis:
**Possible Diagnosis:**
- The AI model predicted this as: meningioma with 98.9% confidence.
- Other potential diagnoses to consider include:
   - Glioma: Less likely due to extra-axial location and enhancement characteristics.
   - Not tumor: Unlikely based on the definitive mass observed.
   - Pituitary adenoma: Unlikely as the mass is above the sella and not centered on the sella turcica.
- Overall, I agree with the AI model’s prediction of meningioma.

Recommended Next Steps:
**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Consider obtaining additional imaging such as:
  - MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging for further characterization.
  - MRI angiography to assess for any vascular involvement.
- Biopsy if the lesion is symptomatic or if there is uncertainty in the diagnosis based on imaging.
- Referral to a neurosurgeon for evaluation and discussion of surgical options if indicated.

Conclusion:
**Conclusion:**
- The MRI findings indicate a likely meningioma. Further evaluation through advanced imaging and potential surgical consultation is recommended to confirm diagnosis and plan treatment.
